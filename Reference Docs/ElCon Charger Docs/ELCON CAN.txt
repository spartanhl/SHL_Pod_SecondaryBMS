How can I use CAN Bus control with my Elcon PFC charger?

If your Elcon PFC charger has been programmed for CAN Bus control and you received a CAN Bus adapter 
with your charger, pin 1 of the adapter must be connected to CAN-Lo from your BMS and pin 2 to CAN-Hi.  
If your BMS does not already have a 120 ohm termination resistor across CAN-Lo and CAN-Hi, you will need 
to add one.  The charger expects to receive every second a message from the BMS with CAN ID 1806E5F4 and 
8-byte data with the voltage and current requested.  If the charger doesn't receive a valid CAN message 
in 5 seconds, it stops charging until it receives a valid CAN message.  The charger sends out every second 
a CAN status message with voltage, current and status information.  Up to 4 chargers with different 
CAN IDs 1806E5F4, 1806E7F4, 1806E8F4 and 1806E9F4 can be connected to the same CAN bus and be controlled 
by one BMS.

"The 29-bit message identifier consists of the regular 11-bit base identifier and an 18-bit identifier extension. 
The distinction between CAN base frame format and CAN extended frame format is accomplished by using the IDE bit 
inside the Control Field (See image below). A low (dominant) IDE bit indicates an 11-bit message identifier; a high 
(recessive) IDE bit indicates a 29-bit id."

"An 11-bit identifier (standard format) allows a total of 211 (= 2048) different messages. A 29-bit identifier (extended format) 
allows a total of 229 (= 536+ million) messages."

"Note: Both formats, Standard (11-bit message ID) and Extended (29-bit message ID) may co-exist on the same CAN bus. 
During bus arbitration, the standard 11-bit message ID frame will always have a higher priority than the extended 
29-bit message ID frame with an identical 11-bit base identifier and thus gain bus access."

"The Extended Format has some trade-offs: The bus latency time is longer (minimum 20 bit-times), messages in extended format 
require more bandwidth (about 20 %), and the error detection performance is reduced (because the chosen polynomial for the 15-bit 
CRC is optimized for frame length up to 112 bits)."
